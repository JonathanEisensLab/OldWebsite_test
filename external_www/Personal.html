Before then, I was an undergraduate at <A HREF="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard
College</A> and graduated from there in 1990. At Harvard I lived in North
House, which is now called<A HREF="http://hcs.harvard.edu/~pfoho/"> Pforzheimer
House</A>, since Oliver North could no longer afford the money to keep his
name on the house. Before Harvard I went to<A HREF="http://whitman.gmu.edu/">
Walt Whitman High School</A> in<A HREF="http://tile.net/bethesda/home.html">
Bethesda, Maryland</A>. Here are some <A HREF="Pictures/Pictures.html">pictures</A>
I have put on the web. And, last and probably least, here is an online version
of my <A HREF="Resume.html">resume.</A> If for some strange reason you want
to learn even more about me, send me <A HREF="mailto:jeisen@leland.stanford.edu">email</A>.
