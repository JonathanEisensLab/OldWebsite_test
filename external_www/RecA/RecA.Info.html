<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Introduction to RecA</H3>

<P>The RecA protein is involved in at least three distinct biological processes
in <I>E. coli</I>:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Homologous recombination (and the recombinational repair of DNA damage).
  <LI>DNA damage induced mutagenesis.
  <LI>Activation of the SOS system.
</UL>

<P>The RecA protein of <I>E. coli</I> has many distinct biochemical activties
including:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>DNA binding (both single and double stranded).
  <LI>Pairing and exchange of homologous DNA.
  <LI>ATP hydrolysis.
  <LI>Coproteolytic cleavage of LexA, UmuD, and the lambda repressor.
</UL>

<P>Homologs of RecA have also been found in other species. </P>

<UL>
  <LI>RecA homologs have been cloned from many bacterial species. The sequence
  and function of RecA is highly conserved among bacteria.
  <LI>In eukaryotes: the Rad51, Rad57, Rad55 and DMC1 proteins
  <LI>In Archaea: RadA and RadB proteins.
  <LI>In phage T4: the UvsX protein.
</UL>

<P>In addition, since there is a crystal structure available of the <I>E.
coli</I> RecA protein and since there are 100s of studies of the effects
of different mutations on the multiple functions of the protein, I believe
RecA can become a model for the studies of protein-structure evolution.
