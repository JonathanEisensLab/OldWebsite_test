<P><B>Abstract</B>: Using RecA as the phylogenetic marker, the relationships
of the green sulfur bacterium <I>Chlorobium</I> <I>tepidum</I> and the green
gliding bacterium <I>Chloroflexus</I> <I>aurantiacus</I> to other eubacteria
were investigated. The <I>recA</I> genes of the two organisms were cloned,
and the resulting protein sequences aligned with 86 other eubacterial RecA
sequences. <I>Cb</I>. <I>tepidum</I> was placed as the nearest relative
to the Cytophaga/ Flexibacter/Bacteroides group, a relationship supported
by results obtained with several phylogenetic markers. <I>Cf</I>. <I>aurantiacus</I>
was placed near <I>Chlamydia</I> <I>trachomatis</I> and the high-GC gram-positives;
however, this placement was not strongly supported statistically. Possible
reasons for this ambiguity are discussed.</P>
