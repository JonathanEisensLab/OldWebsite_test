<B>8/23/94</B><BR>
<BR>
Well, we're off. We're on the runway in<BR>
Seattle, backing up about to take off for <BR>
Anchorage. The plane is uncomfortable, <BR>
to say the least, but hey, what should I <BR>
expect. We'll be there soon.<BR>
<BR>
<B>8/23-contd</B><BR>
<BR>
We met Lisa at the Airport. She and Ross<BR>
were sitting there in full grunge style <BR>
waiting for us to show up. We picked up<BR>
the Barney colored Ford Explorer &amp;<BR>
headed out - first to the Gibbs's and then <BR>
to REI and safeway. Lisa got a backpack<BR>
at REI, we got food at Safeway, and drove<BR>
off North towards Denali. We stopped <BR>
along the way at an OK campground along <BR>
a river and set up camp.<BR>

<BR>
8/24<BR>
<BR>
Got up the next morning and headed out<BR>
towards Denali. Stopped along the way<BR>
at a view point and got to Denali around <BR>
12:30. No campsites available, not much<BR>
backcountry stuff available. So we went<BR>
to a KOA, set up our tents and went for<BR>
a little hike along Stampede Rd.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Resources/image3.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
There was a little lake at the end that we hiked<BR>
down to. There was anice view of the mountains.<BR>
The we went back to the KOA and hung out<BR>
in the wind and then the rain. Had beans and<BR>
cheese and tortillas for dinner, Went to sleep<BR>
early.<BR>
<BR>
<B>8/25/94</B><BR>
<BR>
Got up early to catch the camper bus into<BR>
the park. It was pretty miserable in the morning <BR>
- cold, windy, wet. But, we headed off. Lisa,<BR>
Ross, and Pasqual got on the bus and MB and<BR>
I waited for the next one. We headed out and<BR>
it started to clear up. It's been clear ever since.<BR>
We got to camp at Sanctuary River after seeing<BR>
a Willow Ptarmigan pair and a Dall Sheep.<BR>
They had set up camp and picked good sites.<BR>
We set up our tent and had lunch and then went <BR>
on a hike. We hiked up the road and then up a <BR>
hill and around and back.<BR>
<BR>
For dinner, we had freeze-dried meals. They<BR>
were OK but a little small. So we took some of<BR>
the free food (beans and hummus) to supplement<BR>
our meal. We then went to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
<B>8/26/94</B><BR>
<BR>
Got up ~7 am. Waited for Mike and Cindy. <BR>
They got in around 10 am. After a bvrief delay MB<BR>
and I stayed aroudn while they went on a hike. <BR>
We went for a little hike up the road. I saw a three-toed <BR>
woodpecker around camp and a Colias across the river. <BR>
Then I went birdwatching across the road and when <BR>
I got back everyone was there. We had freeze-dried <BR>
dinners again.<BR>
<BR>
<B>8/27/94</B><BR>
<BR>
Got up early and Pasqual, MB, Lisa, <BR>
Ross and I headed to Eilson Visitor Center <BR>
on the Bus. We didn't eat breakfast and we <BR>
didn't grab too much food. We didn't see much <BR>
of anything along the way - a few Dall Sheep, <BR>
a fox (silver-tailed) with a ptarmigan in its <BR>
mouth. It was snowing along the way and <BR>
very cold. At Eilson we watched other people <BR>
eat and went for a very short hike. Then, cold <BR>
and hungry, we got onto a bus back. It was <BR>
clearing and warmer but we still didn't see <BR>
much of anything. A trio of foxes, a few <BR>
caribou, not much else.<BR>
<BR>
Then we got back to camp and packed <BR>
up and left and abandoned Mike. We left <BR>
him a note, caught the 4:55 shuttle bus we <BR>
had reservations for, and went to the visitor <BR>
center. Didn't see much on the way back <BR>
except some very weird people.<BR>
<BR>
We packed up, went to the KOA to <BR>
shower, had dinner at the Sourdough Cafe <BR>
and then found a site on the side of the <BR>
highway and set up camp (Bought MB a <BR>
birthday present - earrings at the gift shop).<BR>
<BR>
<B>8/28</B><BR>
<BR>
Got up - went to the visitor center - no bus <BR>
'til 12:45 - went to breakfast at the Sourdough <BR>
Cafe. Bought groceries and waited. Mike <BR>
actually showed up after a brief delay and we <BR>
headed off on the Denali Highway. It was <BR>
beautiful - an amazing ride. Saw some <BR>
trumpeter swans - stopped many times and <BR>
finally made it out. We found a campsite <BR>
called Paxson Lake which was very very nice. <BR>
Set up camp late and went to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
<B>8/29/94</B><BR>
<BR>
Got up late - broke camp around 11-11:30 <BR>
and headed towards Wrangell. After more <BR>
delays we got to the park headquarters and <BR>
after listening to the ranger and watching the <BR>
movie about Kennicott - and waiting more - <BR>
we headed to Chitna.<BR>
<BR>
Chitna was cool - hippyish and artsy. <BR>
Then we decided to check out Nugget Creek <BR>
campground. After Mike missed the turn we <BR>
headed up a nasty dirt road and stopped at a <BR>
creek crossing and hiked in a ways to a nice <BR>
campsite. Cooked on the path and spent ~45 <BR>
minutes trying to tie a bear bag. But we did it.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<B>8/30</B><BR>
<BR>
Got up early and hiked out. Pasqual <BR>
was behind as usual but we left anyway. <BR>
We got to the stream - I hiked across and <BR>
then drove the Explorer over the creek. We <BR>
made breakfast. Pasqual finally showed up <BR>
and we drove and drove and drove and drove <BR>
'til we got to McCarthy.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Resources/image5.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
We took the tram across and hiked to town.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Resources/image6.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
We hung out for a while while Lisa and Ross <BR>
headed to Kennicott. Then Pasqual decided to <BR>
go for a walk and so did we. We headed up the <BR>
road to McCarthy and we thought we saw a <BR>
small black bear cross the road.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="Resources/image7.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
We stopped and then headed up the trail to <BR>
Kennicott and we saw the bear again. It took off <BR>
into the woods. We waited and then Pasqual <BR>
came down the road. He had seen a momma <BR>
and a baby.<BR>
<BR>
We then went out to the boulder fileds on <BR>
the river and then we had Pizza in town (it was <BR>
very good). Finally we left (after a strange encounter <BR>
with a kid who had the same birthday as me).<BR>
<BR>
We drove back and camped just outside of <BR>
Chitna at a very nice campground along the river.<BR>
<BR>
<B>8/31</B><BR>
<BR>
I'm 26. Got up and drove to Chitna where we met <BR>
Mike and headed down the road. We drove all the <BR>
way to Hope. We saw a big male caribou along the <BR>
way but not much else. We also stopped at a gas <BR>
station that was closed and had &quot;crime scene&quot; tape <BR>
all around it. It turns out someone had been beaten <BR>
up with a baseball bat.<BR>
<BR>
Then we went to Safeway and REI and finally <BR>
got to Hope where we camped at Porcupine Campground.<BR>
<BR>
<B>9/1</B><BR>
<BR>
Hiked out to Gull Rock for a very very long hike <BR>
along the Turnagain arm. This was after dropping <BR>
Lisa and Ross at the Resurrection Pass trailhead. <BR>
MB and I went on our own. I saw a white-winged <BR>
crossbill. Finally we got there and had lunch. Then <BR>
we got cold and made a fire and finally Mike, Pasqual, <BR>
and Cindy showed up.<BR>
<BR>
We hung out for a few hours and finally headed <BR>
back. We got back exhausted. Gull Rock was OK - <BR>
nice view - it would be a great place to camp - but <BR>
a pain to find. The marking were very very poor.<BR>
<BR>
<B>9/2/94</B><BR>
<BR>
Got up late. Hiked down to the beach below. Then <BR>
MB and I hiked in to Hope cutting through someone's <BR>
backyard. We wandere din to Hope - had some coffee <BR>
and then walked home.<BR>
<BR>
Then I dropped Mike and Cindy at the Resurrection <BR>
Creek Road. I went back and we hung out for a while. <BR>
Then Mike and Cindy returned.<BR>
<BR>
<B>9/3</B><BR>
<BR>
We got up pretty late and left camp and went for a <BR>
hike on the Resurrection Creek trail. We hiked for <BR>
about 4 miles. The trail was heavily used and <BR>
crowded (compared to the rest of Alaska).<BR>
<BR>
MB and I turned around and went back and <BR>
slept in the truck. When M, C, and P got back <BR>
we drove off towards Seward. All the campgrounds <BR>
were full and we ended up staying in Hell's Kitchen, <BR>
a grassy plot in a constructions site. It smelled of <BR>
sewage, the showers and bathrooms were filthy, <BR>
but it was a place off the highway. I should send a <BR>
complaint to Chevron.<BR>
<BR>
<B>9/4/94</B><BR>
<BR>
Packed up and drove to Seward. Had breakfast at <BR>
Don's Kitchen - tons and tons of food. Then we took a <BR>
2.5 hour $40 tour of Resurrection Bay. We saw otters, <BR>
sea lions, puffins, bald eagles, kittiwakes, and some <BR>
other things. It was OK.<BR>
<BR>
Then we wandered around Seward and headed to <BR>
pick up Lisa. We saw lots of beluga whales in Turnagain <BR>
arm on the way back. We split up after much fighting <BR>
and MB, P, and I stayed at a Best Western on Speward <BR>
and M, C, L, and R stayed at the Speward Motel.<BR>
<BR>
We took showers, had dinner at Mc'Ds and packed.<BR>
<BR>
<B>9/5</B><BR>
<BR>
Got up. Waited forever to be seated at the Lounge. <BR>
P and MB had breakfast and then we met M, C and R <BR>
and drove to the fair in Palmer. The fair was pretty <BR>
lame overall.<BR>
